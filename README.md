# b cop(WIP name)

This is a discord anti scam message bot which at time of writing uses a naive check for an everyone ping and a http/https url to determine if a message is a scam but is intended to use a bayes classifier in the future. Commits should follow [semantic commit messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) from here on to allow for easier searching through commits.
